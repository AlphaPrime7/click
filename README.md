# Click

- Learning to make clis using python.
- After some failures with setup.py user options, I had to think of an alternate solution to achieving this part of my python curriculum without feeling so dissapointed.
- The solution was using click to see if I can incorporate this into my python setup.py or even just make my own cli commands and options for use in the development of my first python package.
