# Click

- Learning to make clis using python.
- After some failures with setup.py user options, I had to think of an alternate solution to achieving this part of my python curriculum without feeling so dissapointed.
- The solution was using click to see if I can incorporate this into my python setup.py or even just make my own cli commands and options for use in the development of my first python package.


# Progress 

- Finally making progress as I learn more about clis with python.
- I wont overcomplicate this as I am happy to have a good idea how python does some things.
- I should be focusing on the main project that will drive proper learning of implementing python algorithms.
